Its content started from a panel discussion on "Research Software Engineering for Clinical Biostatistics" which took place at the 43rd Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB) in Newcastle in August 2022.

## Objective of this keynote

::: {.incremental}

- I would like to kick off a good discussion (hopefully also beyond this talk) so that we can learn from each other
- I would like you to reflect on how biostatistics is being carried out on a daily basis in your organizations
  - Why biostatistics? Because we are at R/Pharma, and also that is what I know about most about
- I would like you to strive to get yourself savvy in good software engineering practices and apply them in your daily job
- I would like you to influence your biostatistics colleagues and departments in our organizations

# Where I am coming from with this topic {background-iframe="https://cicdguy.github.io/colored-particles/"}

## My path to biostatistics in Pharma

::: {.incremental}

- I was good in math and I really liked stochastics   
  ("What is the chance of winning the lottery?")
- But I always had fun programming  
  (Remember those days of 
    [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and 
    [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal)?)
- I was also interested in medicine ...   
  ... but I could faint when watching somebody draw blood from my arm
- So I chose statistics because I could combine math and programming, 
  and work with medical data!
- I was formally trained as a statistician (B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D.)
- I started working in the Pharma industry as a biostatistician

:::

## What I did *not* do during those first years

::: {.incremental}

- I did not store my programs in version control systems
- I did not worry too much about making my code readable by others
- I did not try to make calculations reproducible
- I did not get any code review of my study design simulations 
- I did not write any unit tests for my packages

:::

## Some tricks I learned in Tech

::: {.incremental}

- After about 5 years I had the opportunity to switch gears and work at Google
- I learned a lot quickly about:
  - how to write unit tests
  - how to use a consistent code style  
  - how to write design documents
  - how to name functions
  - how to review code and respond to review feedback
  - how to check in code into the (internal) repository
- Also, but not that important:
  - how to write SQL queries, macros, unit tests for those
  - got to know memes and how to create new ones

:::

## But Pharma is more fun for me

::: {.incremental}

- I really liked that I did a lot of programming in a structured way in Google
- But I missed the scientific aspects from Pharma ...   
  ... where we deal not just with numbers, but also biology, medicine, patients, medical doctors, etc.
- And Roche just started venturing more into R territory  
  (keyword: NEST project)
- So I switched back to Roche, because it is a great place to work
- And I see lots of potential to apply Tech skills in Pharma!   
  ⇨ This is the topic this presentation  
  ⇨ How can we improve the way we work with code in Pharma?

# Programming is ubiquitous, but (still) neglected {background-iframe="https://cicdguy.github.io/colored-particles/"}

## Note

- I am trying to zoom in here on the "pain points"
- This is based on anecdotal stories from different organizations
- This is *not* based on surveys or quantitative evidence collected in a structured way
- In the discussion (here and later) we can learn more from each other
  - If your experience is similar, feel free to share the pain points
  - If your experience is different, then that is great and I would love to learn about it 
  
## (Almost) All biostatisticians code

::: {.incremental}

- We don't use calculators anymore, right?
- There are a lot of graphical tools that we can use for simple tasks ...  
  ... but it won't be sufficient for most biostatistics use cases
- We learn programming, maybe already in high school, or latest in undergraduate courses
- We wrangle, analyze, visualize, predict, ... biomedical data with code every day

:::

## But many don't take it serious enough

::: {.incremental}

- Most of the coding we do alone without any discussion or review
- We often copy and paste code from each other and adapt it every time
- We often distinguish ourselves from "Statistical Programmers" and give them instructions  
  (and feel we are better than them)
- We often shy away from sharing our code because we think it is too ugly
- We often don't take enough time to write clean code because we are too busy
- We often just develop code locally on our laptops
- We rarely use version control systems

:::

# Why is this a problem? {background-iframe="https://cicdguy.github.io/colored-particles/"}

## Cannot handover to other statisticians

::: {.incremental}

- Statisticians (too) take vacations, go on longer leave, switch companies, etc.
- Then another statistician (peers, managers) needs to back up or take over the project
- They might need to revisit the design or analyses and thus need to modify the code
- Might not find the code at all (because not in a version controlled repository)
- Might not be able to understand the code (because unreadable by others)

:::

## Cannot maintain code

::: {.incremental}

- Not just switching between different statisticians, but also over time, things can become difficult
  - When I read code from one, two years ago, it is almost code from another person
  - If I look back at my quickly written, ugly code, which is not documented, I have a very hard time
- If you change to the copy and paste code, it won't help anybody else
  - If you discover bugs, those cannot be fixed across projects in one go
  - If you add functionality, it will not be inherited by the other projects

:::

## Cannot prevent bugs

::: {.incremental}

- If we change the code and don't have tests, we don't know if it still works correctly
- Typically we just run then the whole script again and if it does not fail with an error we think it is fine 
- But it might still produce wrong results due to new bugs
- And if we fix a bug, and don't add a test for it at the same time, it might come back later
- This is even more important in software packages that we create for us and others

:::

## Cannot reproduce results

::: {.incremental}

- When we don't prepare for it, new versions of R or R packages can lead to different results  
  ⇨ This can be a real problem e.g. during inspections
- Very hard to reproduce manual steps:
  - e.g. moving data around, running scripts, creating documents, etc.
  - would need to be thoroughly documented to have a small chance, but that is usually omitted
- But Statistics is a key component of the scientific value chain ...   
  ... thus has a responsibility to ensure reproducibility 

:::

## Cannot submit to external stakeholders

::: {.incremental}

- If we cannot share reliably internally in the company, then less so with external stakeholders
- So far, analyses that need to be shared with regulators are often rewritten by statistical programmers
  - Duplicates the work with original coding and has additional risk of introducing bugs
  - But is usually not done for study protocol contents (sample size, simulations)
- Often reporting code was translated to proprietary software because that was considered the only "validated" way
  - Still can have bugs in any software and the actual analysis scripts and macros

:::

# What can we do about it? {background-iframe="https://cicdguy.github.io/colored-particles/"}

## Become aware of the issues

::: {.incremental}

- Most statisticians actually have examples where lax programming led to such problems
- Let's realize that a lot is at stake:   
  we are not building airplanes that could fall from the sky ...   
  ... but we are impacting the life of patients!
- It matters for patients that we 
  - calculate the right sample size, 
  - more generally determine the right clinical trial design, 
  - help finding the right molecules based on preclinical experiments, 
  - etc.

:::

## Take software engineering seriously

::: {.incremental}

- We know what we should do, let's just take the time and energy to do it
- We can learn a lot from the statistical programmers:
  - organize ourselves with standards (starts with naming conventions for files and folders)
  - automate repetitive tasks
  - consider double programming of key results
- Processes should consider code in the same priority as documents (statistical analysis plans etc.)
  - that implies code review, good and consistent code style, business continuity, ...
- Strive to be on par with Tech companies with regards to coding quality

:::

## Educate, educate, educate

::: {.incremental}

- Starts with secondary schools: 
  - computer science should become a standard subject, not just be an extra
  - same importance as math, geography, physics, etc.
- Continues with undergraduate and graduate programs:
  - computer science must become a key component of statistics and data science programs
  - good software engineering practices warrant dedicated courses
- Continues with post-graduate education during the work life:   
  online courses, software engineering workshops, conference sessions, etc.

:::

## Establish dedicated teams

::: {.incremental}

- Research Software Engineering teams are now established in academia, including data science institutions
- Similarly pharma companies are establishing software engineering focused teams
- Direct focus is often development of reusable software
- We should not stop there but also strive to improve the day to day work:   
  biostatistics, medical writing, preclinical experiments, etc.
- Software engineering work is complex, so we need top talents for this

:::

## Provide attractive career paths

::: {.incremental}

- Need to be able to attract and retain top talents
- Defining the job role can have different perspectives
  - We can think about an evolution of "statistical programmers"
  - Or a convergence of "statisticians" and "statistical programmers"
  - Or a new definition of "statistical software engineers"
- Important is to make these careers attractive:
  - same compensation as for biostatisticians or methodology experts
  - same respect in the hierarchy of disciplines
  - same career levels possible including leadership roles

:::

## Collaborate across companies

::: {.incremental}

- More natural now that we use R and other open source software
- Has been made so much easier in the last decade  
  (e.g. video conferencing, cloud based documents, code sharing platforms)
- Stakeholders ask for companies to work together towards standards,   
  rather than receiving different solutions from each company
- Loosely coupled software modules allow to "plug and play"
  - combining different modules to make them fit company standards
  - conneting to internals via company specific extensions
- Key opportunity in contrast to previous proprietary software based, company siloed, stack

# Just A Few Examples {background-iframe="https://cicdguy.github.io/colored-particles/"}

## R Package [`crmPack`](https://roche.github.io/crmPack)

::: {.incremental}

- `crm` stands for continual reassessment method (Bayesian design for dose escalation)
- We started in 2013 with custom R scripts running `JAGS` code to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
- Realized in 2014 that we need to have a way to avoid copy and paste of these via an R package
- Published on CRAN in 2015
- Described in a paper in 2019, and other companies started to use it
- Joined forces about end of 2021 to develop the package further together

:::

## Working group [`openstatsware`](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/)

::: {.incremental}

- Has been founded in August 2022 as working group in the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section
- ~40 members from over 25 pharma companies, CRO, etc.
  - open for new members
- Focuses on 
  1. building packages together (already on CRAN are `mmrm` and `brms.mmrm`)
  2. disseminating good software engineering (SWE) practices (workshops, videos)
- More details were in the talk by Ya Wang from Tuesday

:::

## Tools for reproducible research

Many great tools exist to help with reproducibility of statistical analyses
(see [CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html)), e.g.:

- `devtools` (2011)
- `checkmate` (2014)
- `lintr` (2014)
- `spelling` (2017)
- `styler` (2017)
- `pkgdown` (2018)
- `precommit` (2020)

:::

## Templates to start from use cases

- Let's realize that a lot depends on doing the software engineering well
- Let's get savvy with the tools and good practices ourselves to improve our habits
- Let's influence our colleagues and managers in our companies to improve structures and processes
- Let's realize the benefits from improved software engineering in biostatistics!
